# basic-ml-credit-risk
This repo contain a jupyter notebook on basic ML-based solution for Credit Risk Modelling. The notebook include various simple data activities such as:

* Data wrangling: Remove duplicates, removing invalid numerical data.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* Data preprocessing: Categorical Encoding, Outlier Removal, Handling Correlated Feature Pairs.
* Model defined as standardization-imputation-prediction model pipeline.
* Hyperparameter tuning by optimizing custom score function on cross-validation scheme.
* Model evaluation against simple benchmark.
